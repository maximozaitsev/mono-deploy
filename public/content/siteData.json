To begin with, the idea was quite basic since it was meant to create a place where people could stay, eat, and even entertain without having to move outside the facility. The hotel has a little less than 200 rooms, and the casino has a full gambling floor and a massive event space that is frequently used for concerts and local performances."

It is a rather stable component of the Calgary casino sphere and its history was based not on dramatic reform or expansion but on consistent operating."
