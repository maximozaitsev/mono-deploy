To begin with, the idea was quite basic since it was meant to create a place where people could stay, eat, and even entertain without having to move outside the facility. The hotel has a little less than 200 rooms, and the casino has a full gambling floor and a massive event space that is frequently used for concerts and local performances."

The Deerfoot is regulated by AGLC which is the regulatory body that controls all licensed gaming in Alberta. Although the casino has not publicly displayed a standalone licence number, its business is regulated by provincial regulations regarding compliance, audits, and responsible gaming."

It is a popular choice of locals due to its home-like feeling, having the same service, and always having gaming, accommodation, and entertainment all under one roof. It is a rather stable component of the Calgary casino sphere and its history was based not on dramatic reform or expansion but on consistent operating."
