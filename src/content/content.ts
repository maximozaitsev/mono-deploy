      `In traditional video slots, many gamblers are accustomed to special symbols such as Scatter and Wild, as well as bonus rounds. Some games offer the opportunity to compete for a progressive jackpot.`,
      `But in the case of Simple Mines, the developers have not provided such functions. The only key feature of the game is the multiplier. With the help of the multiplier, you can get up to x100 winnings depending on your bet size. There are no more bonus rounds and features. But according to most players, they are not needed. The game provides a high level of emotions and adrenaline even without special additional features. After all, every step is always as unpredictable as possible.`,
      `At the same time, remember that online casinos give their own bonuses and hold various promotions. You can get welcome rewards, reload bonuses, cashback, free spins and much more.`,
      `If you decide to play the popular game based on Minesweeper from the InOut Games studio, then you will need a simple step-by-step instruction.`,
      `The goal of the game is quite simple and clear. Each successful choice is an opportunity to get a higher multiplier. For example, if you have chosen only 3 mines on the playing field, then after the first successful step you get a multiplier of x1.07, for two correct steps x1.23 and so on. If you have opened 10 cells and have not hit a mine, then your bet is increased by a multiplier of x4.8. At any time, you can stop and collect your money. To do this, just click on the Cash out button on the left side of the playing field.`,
      `Achieving a positive result when playing Simple Mines is much easier than you can imagine. All this thanks to intuitive gameplay, high RTP and medium volatility. Don't rely solely on luck. It's better to use a few useful tips.`,
      `The most important thing is to enjoy and get vivid emotions from the game.`,
