The casino is licensed by the Curaçao Gaming License but does not have the required UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) license to operate in the UK. UK users claim to have occasional access to the platform to place bets, although they do not have a regulatory license from the UKGC. The lack of a UKGC license exposes players to security risks, as casinos in such circumstances must adhere to the UK’s less stringent security measures. At this Memo Casino reviews, lucrative bonuses and a decent rating attract gamblers."
