Although this licensing license enables it to support players everywhere in the world, including Canada, it is not as stringent as regulators such as UKGC or MGA. However, Kyngs Casino is concerned about the security of its players, and it uses SSL encryption, certified random number generators on its game-related activities, and it has the responsible gaming option on its platform that allows the player to limit deposits, take a cooling off, and exclude oneself."
