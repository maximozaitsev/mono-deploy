That means you can be on your laptop at home, then switch to your phone on the go without losing your place or bonus progress. Pretty handy when you’re out and about craving a quick pokies fix."

Sometimes it's a safety feature to protect you from scammers, so it ain’t personal. Keep your ID details ready, and they’ll sort you out fast. I recommend keeping calm and chatting with support—they’re generally super helpful."
