The Play Now casino offers a hotline for gambling problems, as well as several options for voluntary self-exclusion, game time limits, or betting limits. The online casino site looks quite restrained. On a white background, you can see a lot of banners, pictures and inscriptions.

The site has a search bar where you can find the right game by name."
